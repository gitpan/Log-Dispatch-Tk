This widget provide: 
- Log::Dispatch::TkText: a read-only text widget (based on Tk::ROText)
  for logging through the Log::Dispatch module.
- Log::Dispatch::ToTk: an interface class to handle logs between
  Log::Dispatch and the Tk widget. (Log::Dispatch::TkText in most
  cases)

Most users will only need to use a Log::Dispatch::TkText widget to
have Log::Dispatch messages written on a text widget. For more fancy
uses, the Log::Dispatch::ToTk class can be used by a dedicated
composite widget.

See the embedded documentation in the module for more details.

Comments and suggestions are always welcome.
